The Red Hat Infrastructure Standard (RH-IS) is an opinionated framework for integrating Red Hat technologies:
- Red Hat Identity Management
- Red Hat Satellite
- Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform

...to build, patch, maintain, secure, and ensure compliance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux at scale, whether solely on-premise, solely via private/public cloud, or in a hybrid multi-cloud environment. 

The Red Hat Infrastructure Standard Adoption Model (RH-ISAM) comprises the processes utilized when designing, configuring, and implementing the RH-IS within an organization. A primary fundamental principle of the RH-ISAM is to strive towards “everything as code”. GitOps practices are used to define the desired states and conduct tests on management infrastructure as well as managed systems through an infrastructure-as-code pipeline, with the goals of repeatability, consistency, and stability. The RH-ISAM uses Red Hat management tools available within a Red Hat Enterprise Linux environment and unifies them with process and automation to deliver RHEL as a Platform via a modern, Standard Operating Environment.
